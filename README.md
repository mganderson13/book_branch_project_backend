# Book Branch

Book Branch is a project inspired by my book loving friends.
It utilizes the Google Books API to display book information and links to PDF versions of books. Book Branch was created with a React front end and Express back end. To save user data Book Branch uses a MongoDB database and is hosted using Google's Firebase hosting services.

## Features

- Immense book library thanks to Google's Book API
- Secure sign in and data storage
- Browsing and searching capabilities
- Users can leave ratings and reviews for books saved to their profile
- Clear and intuitive user interface
- The design is responsive for larger screens, but mobile optimization is still in progress

## Stack

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end utilizes the React library, imports book information using Google's Book API, and allows sign in through Firebase Auth. The back-end uses the Express framework and stores user information for their profile on MongoDB.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can browse books, search for a specific title or author, and create an account to save books and leave reviews.
